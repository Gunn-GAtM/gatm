\noindent Thanks to \textbf{Josh Zucker}, who wrote the first draft of several chapters, particularly Geometry of Complex Numbers, Vitamin $i$, Matrix Multiplication, and the first part of Inverses.

\noindent Also, thanks to my fellow teachers at Gunn High School \textbf{Dave Deggeller} and \textbf{Danny Hahn} for resurrecting the use of this pamphlet in their 11\textsuperscript{th} grade Analysis classes, and to their Analysis classes of 2013--14 who took on the project of retyping the text after the loss of the soft copy in a computer theft.

\noindent In addition, thanks to \textbf{Gautam Mittal} for editing the text for the 2017--18 academic year.

\noindent Above all, thanks to student assistant \textbf{Maya Sankar} (2014) for her work on editing the text, typesetting the text in \LaTeX{}, and incorporating an answer key; \textbf{Timothy Herchen} (2020) for editing and rewriting the text; \textbf{Brandon Chung} and \textbf{Andrew Chang} (2020) for additional help on the text, formatting, and cover; and \textbf{Yu-Ting Chang} (2021) for correcting errors and making technical improvements to the textbook's code.
